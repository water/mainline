# There is a bug in Rack causing multipart form posts to fail under Ruby 1.9

# If we are on 1.9, let's load up the patch from lib. Since this patch has to replace an entire class from 
# Rack, we will explode if the Rack version isn't 1.0 - which is what it's intended for
# 
# If this happens to you, please verify that the code is in fact correct
