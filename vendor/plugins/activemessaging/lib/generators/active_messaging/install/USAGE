Description:
    Configures your application to use active messaging. The following files are installed:
    1. config/broker.yml - Configures the broker that you will be using. 
    2. script/poller - This script will start/stop/run the process that will be polling your broker. The name of this file/process is configurable. See Usage below. 
    3. lib/poller.rb - The poller script will use this file to start up ActiveMesssaging
  
    The generator will also create a app/processors directory and modify your application.rb so that app/processors is in the autoload path

Usage:
    If you do not pass in an argument then the poller filename/process will be called poller. You can override this default by passing in the name that you want the file and process to be. 
  
Examples:
    rails g activemessaging:install
  
      Installs activemessaging with the poller process named poller

    rails g activemessaging:install POLLER_NAME
  
      Installs activemessaging but allows you to customize the name of the poller
