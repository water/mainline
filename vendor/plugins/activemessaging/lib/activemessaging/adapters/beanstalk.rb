# One caveat: beanstalk does not accept the underscore '_' as a legal character in queue names. 
# So in messaging.rb you'll need to modify your queue names to use something other than the underscore, a dash perhaps.
# Accepting the underscore as a valid char in queue names is an open issue in beanstalk, and should be fixed in a future version.
