  <p>
    Gitorious provides open source infrastructure for hosting open source projects
    that use Git. The central entity in Gitorious is the project, which contains 
    one or more top-level repositories and any repositories managed by the project's
    contributors. <br />
    This allows you, as a project administrator, to keep an eye on what people
    are working on in their individual clones of your repositories. It also lets 
    Likewise, as a project contributor, you get a place to host your contributions
    and provide f_eedback back into the projects ecosystem and easily collaborate
    with others on the same project. You get your own personal clone of the project
    on the site that you can work freely in and a way to package up your changes 
    and notify the other project members about your changes.

  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>
    Gitorious was started by Johan SÃ¸rensen in the end of 2007 as a way to easily
    host Git repositories for himself. The idea turned out to be so useful that 
    Gitorious began to offer hosting for other projects as well, for free, 
    eventually opening up for anyone to create an account.
  </p>
  <p>
    In March 2009 Gitorious.org was folded into <a href="http://shortcut.no">Shortcut AS</a>, 
    a software company co-founded by Johan. The intention was to improve 
    Gitorious  beyond what was feasible for a single developer to manage. 
    Shortcut AS now  officially supports and develops Gitorious in cooperation 
    with contributors outside the company, while still being 100% open source 
    under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.txt">GNU Affero General Public License</a>.
